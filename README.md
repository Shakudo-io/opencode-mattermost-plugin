[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/opencode-mattermost-control.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-mattermost-control)

Control [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) remotely via Mattermost direct messages. Send prompts to your OpenCode session by messaging a bot user, and receive real-time streaming responses.

## Features

- **Thread-Per-Session**: Each OpenCode session automatically gets its own dedicated Mattermost thread for clean conversation isolation
- **Remote Control**: Send prompts to OpenCode via Mattermost DMs
- **Multi-Session Management**: Control multiple OpenCode sessions in parallel via separate threads
- **Session Monitoring**: Get DM alerts when sessions need attention (permission requests, idle, questions)
- **Real-time Streaming**: Responses stream back in chunks with intelligent buffering
- **File Attachments**: Send and receive files through Mattermost
- **Emoji Commands**: React with emojis to control sessions
  - ✅ Approve pending permission
  - ❌ Deny pending permission  
  - 🛑 Cancel current operation
  - 🔁 Retry last prompt
  - 🗑️ Clear session files
- **Notifications**: Get notified on completion, errors, and status changes
- **Multi-user Support**: Handle multiple users with separate sessions
- **Automatic Reconnection**: WebSocket auto-reconnects with exponential backoff

## Quick Start for Humans

### Prerequisites

- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) installed and configured
- A Mattermost instance with API access
- A Mattermost bot account with appropriate permissions
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime (recommended) or Node.js 18+

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

```bash
# Using bun (recommended)
bun add -g opencode-mattermost-control

# Or using npm
npm install -g opencode-mattermost-control
```

### Step 2: Create a Mattermost Bot

1. Go to your Mattermost **System Console** → **Integrations** → **Bot Accounts**
2. Click **Add Bot Account**
3. Give it a username (e.g., `opencode-bot`) and description
4. Copy the generated **Access Token** - you'll need this!

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

```bash
export MATTERMOST_TOKEN="your-bot-access-token"
export MATTERMOST_URL="https://your-mattermost-instance.com/api/v4"
```

### Step 4: Connect from OpenCode

```bash
# Start OpenCode in your project
opencode

# Then type or use the tool:
mattermost_connect
```

You should see:
```
✓ Connected to Mattermost as @opencode-bot
✓ Listening for DMs
✓ Project: your-project-name
```

### Step 5: Send Prompts via DM

Open Mattermost, find your bot user, and send it a direct message:
```
Create a hello world function in Python
```

The response will stream back in real-time!

## Quick Start for AI Agents

If you're an AI agent setting up this plugin, follow these steps:

### 1. Install

```bash
bun add -g opencode-mattermost-control
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Set these environment variables before starting OpenCode:

```bash
export MATTERMOST_TOKEN="<bot-access-token>"
export MATTERMOST_URL="https://<mattermost-host>/api/v4"
```

### 3. Connect

Use the `mattermost_connect` tool to establish connection:

```
mattermost_connect
```

### 4. Verify Connection

Use `mattermost_status` to confirm the connection is active.

### 5. Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mattermost_connect` | Establish connection to Mattermost |
| `mattermost_disconnect` | Terminate connection |
| `mattermost_status` | Check connection state |
| `mattermost_list_sessions` | List available OpenCode sessions |
| `mattermost_select_session` | Select which session receives prompts |
| `mattermost_current_session` | Show currently targeted session |
| `mattermost_monitor` | Monitor session for events (permission, idle, question) |
| `mattermost_unmonitor` | Stop monitoring a session |

### 6. Handling DMs

Once connected, DMs to the bot are processed as follows:

**Prompt Format:**
```
[Mattermost DM from @username]
[Reply-To: thread=abc123 post=xyz789 channel=dm_channel_id]
<user's message>
```

The `Reply-To` line provides context for agents with other Mattermost integrations (MCP servers, direct API) to reply to the correct thread.

**Auto-Session Creation:**
If a user sends a message in the main DM (not in a thread) and no sessions exist, a new OpenCode session is automatically created. This can be disabled with `OPENCODE_MM_AUTO_CREATE_SESSION=false`.

### 7. Session Commands

Users can send these commands via DM to manage sessions:
- `!sessions` - List all available OpenCode sessions
- `!use <id>` - Switch to a specific session
- `!current` - Show currently selected session
- `!help` - Show available commands

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start OpenCode
opencode

# 2. Connect to Mattermost
> mattermost_connect
✓ Connected to Mattermost as @your-bot
✓ Listening for DMs

# 3. Check status anytime
> mattermost_status

# 4. Disconnect when done
> mattermost_disconnect
```

### Thread-Per-Session Workflow

When the plugin connects, it automatically creates a dedicated Mattermost thread for each active OpenCode session. This provides clean conversation isolation and parallel session control.

**How it works:**
1. When a new OpenCode session starts, a thread is automatically created in your DM with the bot
2. The thread root post shows session info (project, directory, session ID)
3. Post in the thread to send prompts to that specific session
4. Responses stream back to the same thread
5. When the session ends, the thread is marked as ended

**Example:**
```
Bot: 🚀 OpenCode Session Started

     Project: my-awesome-app
     Directory: /home/user/projects/my-awesome-app
     Session: ses_abc1
     Started: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z

     Reply in this thread to send prompts to this session.

You (in thread): List all TypeScript files
Bot (in thread): [Streaming response...]
```

**Main DM commands:**
- `!sessions` - List all sessions with links to their threads
- `!help` - Show available commands

**Thread behavior:**
- Prompts in main DM (outside threads) are rejected with guidance to use session threads
- Each thread maps to exactly one OpenCode session
- Thread posts are routed to the correct session automatically
- Ended sessions show a completion message and reject new prompts

### Session Management Commands

When connected, you can manage multiple OpenCode sessions via DM commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!sessions` | List all available OpenCode sessions with thread links |
| `!help` | Display available commands and thread workflow |

**Example:**
```
You: !sessions
Bot: 📋 Available Sessions (2)

     1. 🟢 my-awesome-app (ses_abc1) - 5m ago
        📁 /home/user/projects/my-awesome-app
        🔗 Thread: [Click to open]

     2. 🟢 another-project (ses_def2) - 2h ago
        📁 /home/user/projects/another-project
        🔗 Thread: [Click to open]

     Reply in a session thread to send prompts.
```

### Emoji Commands

React to any bot message with these emojis:

| Emoji | Action |
|-------|--------|
| ✅ | Approve pending permission request |
| ❌ | Deny pending permission request |
| 🛑 | Cancel current operation |
| 🔁 | Retry the last prompt |
| 🗑️ | Clear session temporary files |

### Session Monitoring

Monitor OpenCode sessions and receive DM alerts when they need attention. Works without requiring an active Mattermost connection.

```bash
# Start monitoring the current session
> /mattermost-monitor

# Or use the tool directly
> mattermost_monitor targetUser="your-username"

# Stop monitoring
> mattermost_unmonitor
```

**Alert types:**
- **Permission requested** - Session is waiting for permission approval
- **Session idle** - Session finished and is waiting for input
- **Question asked** - Session is asking a clarifying question

**Example alert:**
```
🔔 OpenCode Session Alert

Project: business-automation
Session: ses_4426 - Mattermost plugin codebase review
Directory: /root/gitrepos/business-automation

⏳ Alert: Session is idle (waiting for input)

Use `!use ses_4426` in DM to connect to this session.
```

**Options:**
- `sessionId` - Monitor a specific session (defaults to current)
- `targetUser` - Mattermost username to notify (required if not connected)
- `persistent` - Keep monitoring after each alert (default: true). Set to false for one-time alerts.

### Multi-Session Setup (Shared Server)

When controlling multiple OpenCode sessions via Mattermost, you need to run them on a **shared server** so that events (like incoming prompts) are visible across all TUIs.

**Why?** By default, each `opencode` command starts its own isolated server. Messages sent to one session won't appear in another session's TUI because they don't share the same event bus.

**Solution:** Use OpenCode's shared server mode:

#### Option 1: Manual Setup

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start the shared server
opencode serve --port 4096

# Terminal 2 - Attach first TUI (run mattermost_connect here)
cd /path/to/project-a
opencode attach http://localhost:4096

# Terminal 3 - Attach second TUI
cd /path/to/project-b
opencode attach http://localhost:4096
```

#### Option 2: Using the Helper Script

A convenience script `opencode-shared` is provided that automatically manages the shared server:

```bash
# First run - starts server in background, then attaches TUI
./opencode-shared

# Subsequent runs - attaches to existing server
./opencode-shared

# With optional password for security
OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD="your-secret" ./opencode-shared
```

The script:
- Checks if a shared server is already running on port 4096
- If not, starts one as a background process
- Attaches a TUI to the shared server
- Logs server output to `/tmp/opencode-server.log`

#### Security Note

For production use, set `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` environment variable on both server and client:

```bash
export OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
opencode serve --port 4096

# In another terminal (same password required)
export OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
opencode attach http://localhost:4096
```

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png)

**Data Flow:**
1. User sends a DM to the bot in Mattermost
2. Plugin receives the message via WebSocket
3. Plugin forwards the prompt to OpenCode CLI
4. OpenCode processes and streams responses back
5. Plugin delivers chunked responses to Mattermost DM

### Components

## Updating the Plugin

OpenCode caches plugins in `~/.config/opencode/node_modules/`. Simply running `bun add -g` or `npm install -g` does **not** update the running plugin. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Update the Version Pin

Edit `~/.config/opencode/package.json` and update the version:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@opencode-ai/plugin": "1.1.21",
    "opencode-mattermost-control": "0.2.19"  // <- Update this version
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Clear the Cache

```bash
# Remove cached package and lockfile
rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/node_modules/opencode-mattermost-control
rm -f ~/.config/opencode/bun.lock
```

### Step 3: Install the New Version

```bash
cd ~/.config/opencode
bun install

# If using a private registry (e.g., Verdaccio):
bun install --registry http://your-registry-url:4873
```

### Step 4: Restart OpenCode

**Critical**: You must completely restart OpenCode for the new plugin code to load. A `mattermost_disconnect` / `mattermost_connect` cycle only reconnects the WebSocket—it does **not** reload plugin code from disk.

```bash
# Exit OpenCode completely (Ctrl+C or close terminal)
# Then start fresh:
opencode
```

### Step 5: Verify

After reconnecting, check the logs to confirm the new version is running:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/opencode-mattermost-plugin.log
```

### Quick Update Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# update-mattermost-plugin.sh
VERSION="${1:-latest}"

echo "Updating opencode-mattermost-control to $VERSION..."

# Update package.json
if [ "$VERSION" = "latest" ]; then
  # Fetch latest version from registry
  VERSION=$(curl -s http://verdaccio.hyperplane-verdaccio.svc.cluster.local:4873/opencode-mattermost-control | jq -r '.["dist-tags"].latest')
fi

# Update version in package.json
cd ~/.config/opencode
cat package.json | jq ".dependencies[\"opencode-mattermost-control\"] = \"$VERSION\"" > package.json.tmp
mv package.json.tmp package.json

# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules/opencode-mattermost-control bun.lock
bun install --registry http://verdaccio.hyperplane-verdaccio.svc.cluster.local:4873

echo "Updated to version $VERSION"
echo "IMPORTANT: Restart OpenCode for changes to take effect!"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Not connected to Mattermost"
Run `mattermost_connect` first.

### "MATTERMOST_TOKEN environment variable is required"
Set the `MATTERMOST_TOKEN` environment variable with your bot's access token.

### WebSocket disconnects frequently
Check network connectivity to the Mattermost server. The client auto-reconnects with exponential backoff.

### Messages not appearing
Ensure you're DMing the bot user directly, not posting in a channel.

### Permission errors
Verify your bot token has the required permissions:
- Post messages
- Read channels
- Upload files (if using file attachments)

### View logs
```bash
tail -f /tmp/opencode-mattermost-plugin.log
```

### Plugin not updating after install
If you installed a new version but the old code is still running:

1. OpenCode caches plugins in `~/.config/opencode/node_modules/`
2. Check the cached version: `cat ~/.config/opencode/node_modules/opencode-mattermost-control/package.json | grep version`
3. Follow the [Updating the Plugin](#updating-the-plugin) section above
4. **You must restart OpenCode completely** - disconnect/reconnect only refreshes the WebSocket, not the plugin code
